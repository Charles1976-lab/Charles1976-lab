  - I'm a brown belt at Google Fu. No matter how good I get my wife is a 10th degree black belt.
  - I manage a complicated network of humans at MyFamilyCorp. My HR manager is passionate to a fault. The staff is wild and barely manageable. We have 3 employees a 21 year old veteran that has departed to start her own branch. We have a 17 year old accolyte that is the head of the art department, but I would like her to expand her style out of anime. We have a 4 year old newbie. This is an interesting one. She thinks she runs the company, but she is too adorable to fire. I also think she is the HR Manager's favorite. The woes of a CEO are many, but they are rewarding.
